## 4.5.1 Homework 4: Write a script that does the following:
### Read in the metadata file. Print a table showing how many individuals we have from each population.

1) Run the clustering analysis using the snmf command. Create a cross-entropy plot.

2) Get a Q matrix for K=5 (used in the paper). Add sample IDs from the metadata file as rownames to the Q matrix. Print the head of the Q matrix.

3) For the “TAS” population, what are the average ancestry proportions from each cluster?

4) Plot the ancestry barplot with populations labelled at the bottom. Color palette is up to you :)

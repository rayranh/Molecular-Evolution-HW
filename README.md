projects and homework problems done in R. The instuctions to each homework file will be given below. 

## Homework 3
Write a script that does the following:
1. Read in "genotypes.csv" and subset the dataframe to Mt Buller samples only. How many samples do you have from each year?
2. Calculate mean observed heterozygosity for each year. Put these into a single dataframe along with a column indicating the year.
3. Calculate mean expected heterozygosity for each year. Add these to the dataframe from question 2.
4. Plot mean expected heterozygosity over time.
5. Add a vertical lines to your plot to show when introductions took place (hint - use the abline command)
